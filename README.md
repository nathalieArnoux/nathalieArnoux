- 👋 Hi, I’m Nathalie Arnoux, a front-end developer looking for an opportunity to show my skills and motivation!
- ✨ I'm a creative, curious and team-oriented person
- 👀 I’m interested in JS & TS, React, CSS and UI/UX, but also video games, space, otters, crafts, etc. I love learning new things so the list could go on and on!
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself TypeScript out of curiosity, and also to improve my chances at landing a job! (And I'm loving it so far, it's great!)
- 🗂️ Go checkout my portfolio at nathaliearnoux.github.io/portfolio => I made it with React and TailwindCSS, that I taught myself on the occasion!
- 📫 Reach me by email at arnouxn@gmail.com or on LinkedIn at /in/nathalie-arnoux and I'll answer ASAP!
- 😄 Pronouns: She / her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have some knowledge in 6 different natural languages! (French, English, Japanese, Italian, Swedish, Korean)
